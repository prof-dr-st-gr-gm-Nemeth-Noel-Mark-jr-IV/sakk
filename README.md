George Perry Floyd Jr.
(October 14, 1973 â€“ May 25, 2020) was an African-American man who was murdered by a police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota, during an arrest made after a store clerk suspected Floyd may have used a counterfeit twenty-dollar bill, on May 25, 2020.[3] Derek Chauvin, one of the four police officers who arrived on the scene, knelt on Floyd's neck and back for 9 minutes and 29 seconds which caused a lack of oxygen.
[4] After his murder, protests against police brutality, especially towards black people, quickly spread across the United States and globally.
His dying words, "I can't breathe," became a rallying slogan.

"I can't breathe, I'm waiting for the exhale
Toss my pain with my wishes in a wishing well
Still no luck, but oh, well"
